# Dog Breed Identification

This project is my attempt at the Kaggle's dog breed identification competition. The dataset consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.

It was my first time working with Deep Learning and using TensorFlow 2.0. I applied Transfer Learning by using the model [mobilenet_v2_130_224](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4) and managed to get a score of 0.89781 in my submission to Kaggle.
